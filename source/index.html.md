# Introduction

Welcome to Accellion's API Guide.

Our RESTful Enterprise API enables you to quickly develop apps that leverage the power of the Accellion Platform. Developers can build custom apps tailored to specific industry and business use cases, as well as integrate with existing IT infrastructure. For example:

* For the auto insurance industry, an insurance broker can manage a repository for the documents related to each claim. Meanwhile, the claimants, adjusters, vendors and lawyers can use custom mobile apps to check off tasks as they add and view their photos, documents and forms related to the claim.
* A catalog of sales items and marketing collateral can be distributed to a worldwide sales force using tablets. Automated folder creation and permissions can ensure the right items and collateral are available to the right peopleâ€™s tablets at the right time.
* File attachments from internal or customer facing web portals can automatically be stored on the Accellion Platform for better security and governance.

# Sample Code
We have sample code available in Python currently. Over time, we will add sample code in other languages. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
