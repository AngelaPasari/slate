**Glossary**

The following section lists the terms and their definitions used in the Kiteworks API domain. 

**Access Token**

An **[Access Token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/access-tokens)**  is an Authorization Token granted to an API client to make API calls for a login session. It identifies the user before authorizing access to a requested protected resource and is implemented between a user, client, and resource.

A **[Lifetime](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/access-token-lifetime/)** is specified for each issued Access Token by the **Admin**-**in**-**Application** > **Client Managemen**t > **Custom Applications**. Once the token expires, a  **[Refresh Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)** can be generated as instructed in **[Refreshing an Access Token](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/making-authenticated-requests/refreshing-an-access-token/)** to obtain a **[New Access Token](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)**.

**API** 

An **Application Programming Interface** (**API**) is a multi-layer interface that implements a set of routines and protocols for building and integrating software applications, using ‘push’ and ‘pull’ protocols behind the User Interface between the Client and Server.

An API can be implemented as:

**Networked API:** Exposed by services across a network using Web protocols such as HTTP. Not all APIs are accessible across the internet.

**Remote API:** Operates across a network and enables manipulating of remote resources that reside outside the system making the request.

**Web API:** The most commonly used Web-based application that implements the common Web HTTP protocol to provide resources as a Web service in a platform-language agnostic format.

Web API requests and responses are negotiated over the HTTP client-server model.

An API can be released under three policies:

- **Private**: For internal use only.
- **Partner**: For use with specific business partners only.
- **Public**: For use by the public.
