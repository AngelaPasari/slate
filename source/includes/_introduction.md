# Introduction

Welcome to Accellion's API Guide.

Our RESTful Enterprise API enables you to quickly develop apps that leverage the power of the Accellion Platform. Developers can build custom apps tailored to specific industry and business use cases, and integrate APIs within existing IT infrastructure.

Currently, sample codes are available in PHP, and will be available in other languages subsequently. The sample codes can be viewed in the right panelf the project board.
