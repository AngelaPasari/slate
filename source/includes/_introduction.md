# Introduction

Welcome to Accellion's API Guide.

The kiteworks RESTful Enterprise APIs enable you to quickly develop apps that leverage the power of the kiteworks Content Platform. The platform provides secure, ubiquitous connectivity to any type of content from any content storage supported by kiteworks, on any device, on-premises or in the cloud. The kiteworks content platform offers developers access to out-of-the box enterprise-grade capabilities for rapidly developing innovative enterprise applications that can securely access, edit, and share enterprise content.

A key component of the platform is the set of RESTful Enterprise APIs that provides developers access to all of the file sharing, collaboration, and sync capabilities of the kiteworks solution. It saves you years of development because it is enterprise-ready out of the box. The platform also provides secure, unified connectivity to documents stored in any content systems, both on-premise systems such as SharePoint and Documentum, as well as cloud systems such as Google Drive and Dropbox. These powerful APIs enable developers to build custom apps tailored to specific industry and business use cases, as well as integrate with existing IT infrastructure. For example:

•	For the auto insurance industry, an insurance broker can manage a repository for the documents related to each claim. Meanwhile, the claimants, adjusters, vendors and lawyers can use custom mobile apps to check off tasks as they add and view their photos, documents and forms related to the claim.
•	A catalog of sales items and marketing collateral can be distributed to a worldwide sales force using tablets. Automated folder creation and permissions can ensure the right items and collateral are available to the right people’s tablets at the right time.
•	A bank can create a deal room for each major deal, and provide secure access to outside parties such as attorneys, agents and inspectors to upload and review documents using their tablets instead of a fax machine
