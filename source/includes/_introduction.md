# Introduction

Welcome to Accellion's API Guide.

Our RESTful Enterprise API enables you to quickly develop apps that leverage the power of the Accellion Platform. Developers can build custom apps tailored to specific industry and business use cases, and integrate APIs with existing IT infrastructure.

Currently sample codes are available in PHP. Sample codes in other languages will abe available in due course. Sample codes can be viewed in the panel to the right of the project board.
