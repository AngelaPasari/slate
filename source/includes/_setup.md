## Prerequisites
You should be an experienced developer and have an understanding of the following concepts and technologies:

* OAuth 2.0
* JSON data format
* HTTP methods and status codes
* REST APIs

## Get access to the API
You will need an Accellion instance to get access to the API. If you don't already have one, please click on the button below:

If you already have an Accellion instance:

1. Sign in to the Admin interface at https://[hostname]/admin. Replace [hostname] with your Accellion instance hostname.
2. Click on the Application tab icon using the top navigation bar.
3. Click on Client Management in the left navigation panel. If you see the Custom Applications section under Client Management, you have everything you need to get started. Otherwise, please email <support@accellion.com> to request API access for your instance.
4. Click on Custom Applications under Client Management.
5. Turn the API Playground ON.
6. Click on the + button to add your custom app. Further steps below the screenshot.
