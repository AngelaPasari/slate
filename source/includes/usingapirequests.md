# Using API Requests
Before moving onto the next exercise, let us dig into the response of the request we just made. There are a couple of important things to highlight. If you look at the response header, you will see a field called **X-Accellion-Location**, which indicates what object is being acted upon. 
**NOTE:**  In the case of an error, this field might not indicate the object being acted upon. Please consult our error-handling documentation for those cases.)

For instance, this is the response header for the request we just made.
